schema is a [Go](https://golang.org) package providing access to database schema metadata, for database/sql drivers.

TODO more docs

Currently supporting the following database engines / SQL dialects:

- Microsoft SQL Server
- MySQL
- Oracle
- Postgres
- SQLite

For a list of supported drivers, and their capabilities with regards to sql.ColumnType support, see [drivercaps](https://github.com/jimsmart/drivercaps)

## Installation
```bash
$ go get github.com/jimsmart/schema
```

```go
import "github.com/jimsmart/schema"
```

### Dependencies

- A [supported](https://github.com/jimsmart/drivercaps) database driver.
- Standard library.
- [Ginkgo](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/) and [Gomega](https://onsi.github.io/gomega/) if you wish to run the tests.
- Tests also require [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to be installed.

## Example

See GoDocs for usage examples.

## Documentation

GoDocs [https://godoc.org/github.com/jimsmart/schema](https://godoc.org/github.com/jimsmart/schema)

## Testing

Database services for testing against are hosted in Docker.

To bring up the database services: execute `docker-compose up` inside the project folder, and wait until all of the Docker services have completed their startup (i.e. there is no further output in the terminal), then open a second terminal. (In future one may choose to use `docker-compose up -d` instead)

To run the tests execute `go test` inside the project folder.

For a full coverage report, try:

```bash
$ go test -coverprofile=coverage.out && go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

To shutdown the Docker services, execute `docker-compose down -v` inside the project folder.
